### To find which plugins are used inside the website
- To look for a plugin directory, simply use the right-click anywhere on the website (except on an image) you are curious about, and then select the `View Page Source` option from the drop-down menu that opens. All that is left for you to do now is to scan the code and look for `wp-content/plugins/` in it.
